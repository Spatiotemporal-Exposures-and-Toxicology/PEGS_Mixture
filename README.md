# PEGS_Mixture
Project on analyzing environmental and climate mixtures on health outcomes with the PEGS cohort


## Research question
- How does the mixture of environmental exposures and climate-socioeconomic conditions affect mental health status in the PEGS cohort?


## Directory structure

- `./manuscript`: LaTeX, bibTeX, and figure files for manuscript
- `./output`: all intermediate results rest here
- `./R`: R codes for analysis
- `./vignettes`: illustrative examples of milestone analyses

## No `./input` in GitHub repository: separated data management

- PEGS data is highly sensitive; no local data storage is allowed
- If additional inputs (e.g., climate data, socioeconomic data, and greenspace data) will be read from a common research storage or local (if it has no sensitive information issues) directories.
